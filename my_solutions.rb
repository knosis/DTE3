# U2.W4: Research Methods

# I spent [1.25] hours on this challenge.

# I want to create a sorting method that alphabetizes an array. I also want to create a sorting method that arranges the data in my hash by age (starting with the youngest first). I want to see what happens when I do this, but I don't want it to modify the existing data. If two animals have the same age, they should be in alphabetical order.

i_want_pets = ["I", "want", 3, "pets", "but", "only", "have", 2]
my_family_pets_ages = {"Evi" => 6, "Ditto" => 3, "Hoobie" => 3, "George" => 12, "Bogart" => 4, "Poly" => 4, "Annabelle" => 0}

# Person 1's solution
def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#

# Person 2
def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Person 3
# def my_array_sorting_method(source)

#   array_sort = source.sort_by { |a| a.to_s }

# end

# def my_hash_sorting_method(source)

# hash_sort = Hash.new {}
# hash_sort = source.sort_by{ |key, value| key }.sort_by{ |key, value| value }
# end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# the ruby method i implemented was sort_by.
# sort by takes a block of code and iterates through each element performing the code in the block
# and returns a new object. usually an array.


# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Person 5
def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_splitting_method(source, age)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.





# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.





# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
