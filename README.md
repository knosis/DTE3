map!: invokes the block ``(x.is_a?(Integer) ? x + num : x)`` for each element x in the array and replaces each element with the value returned by the block
``is_a?(Integer)``: checks the class of each object/element within an array. In this case, it's being used to check if an element is an Integer. If the class is an integer, the block returns ``x + num`` to replace the element; if not, it just replaces the element with itself.

##Person 3 solution explained##
My solution for the array uses the method ``sort_by``. ``sort_by`` is not implenented by arrays by default however ``sort_by!`` is. ``sort_by`` is an Enumerable and it always takes a block of code and executes it on every object in the array. There are 3 ways i found to define the block if the recieving object (the array) does not implement a ``sort_by`` method. the first is:
```ruby
  sort_by do |a, b|
  #some block of code...
  end
```
the block you pass to the reciever determines the sort order.

The second is ``sort_by { |a, b| some comparision code i.e(a <=> b)...} `` where you give the proper way to compare two objects against each other.

The third way to implement ``sort_by`` is ``sort_by { |a| comparison a.to_i}`` here you give ``sort_by`` only one argument to compare all objects.

In my solution I used the third implementation method and told it to first turn all objects into strings and then call the default sort method. which is alphanumeric.

My second solution also uses ``sort_by`` which is avaliable to both arrays and hashes through enumeration. The difference between them here is that when called on a hash, ``sort_by`` returns a hash. I first call ``sort_by`` on the keys, and then I called ``sort_by`` on the returned hash's values. I tired it the opposite way first but that had the effect of first ordering the objects by key and then by value.

##Person 4 solution explained##

I used the methods: count, delete, class and include?
- count: counts occurances of the element it is passed (a letter in this case)
- delete: deletes the element it is passed (if passed "car" then "car" is deleted) from the array.
- include?: checks to see if an item is included in an array.
- class: returns the class of an object.
